- Hi, I’m Aman Rai @amanrai2508
- I’m interested in Analytics and Product Mangement.
- Why Analytics? solving the problem by understanding underneath kind of interests and motivates me.
- Why Product Managment? When applying analytics, in some way or another we talk about product. And When an Analyst suggest about a new problem or a feature it is the product manager who takes the last decision.
- I’m currently applying my acquired knowledge of SQL and Tableau to understand real world problems by doing projects that are relevant for the real world.
AB testing and Investigating a drop are examples of that.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that uses analytics to undertand the real world problem like change in human behaviour while purchasing etc.
